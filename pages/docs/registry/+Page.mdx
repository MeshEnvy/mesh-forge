# Mesh Plugin Registry

The Mesh Plugin Registry is a collection of community-developed plugins that extend Meshtastic firmware functionality. This guide explains how to discover, use, and build firmware with plugins from the registry.

## What is the Registry?

The registry contains plugins that add new features and capabilities to Meshtastic devices. Each plugin is maintained by the community and can be easily integrated into custom firmware builds.

## How to Use Plugins

### Using Mesh Forge (Recommended)

The easiest way to use plugins is through [Mesh Forge](https://meshforge.org/builds/new), which lets you build custom firmware with plugins directly in your browser:

1. Visit [meshforge.org/builds/new](https://meshforge.org/builds/new)
2. Browse available plugins from the registry
3. Select the plugins you want to include
4. Build your custom firmware
5. Download and flash the firmware to your device

**Benefits:**

- Zero installation required
- Simple web interface
- Automatic dependency resolution
- Ready-to-flash firmware files

### Using Mesh Plugin Manager (Advanced)

For local development and more control, you can use the [Mesh Plugin Manager](https://pypi.org/project/mesh-plugin-manager/) command-line tool:

1. Install Mesh Plugin Manager: `pip install mesh-plugin-manager`
2. Set up PlatformIO and Poetry (required dependencies)
3. Use the CLI to build firmware with selected plugins
4. Flash the firmware to your device

**Benefits:**

- Full control over the build process
- Local development workflow
- CLI interface for automation
- Developer-friendly
