# MeshForge Licensing Notice

## 1. Generated Projects (the zip files you download)

Every project you download from MeshForge is a modified version of one or more upstream open-source code bases. The primary codebase is licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3 (GPLv3).

Because the GPLv3 is "viral", the entire combined work you receive — including the original GPLv3 code plus all patches, plugins, themes, or extensions added by MeshForge or selected by you — is licensed **exclusively** under the GNU GPLv3.

- You may use, modify, and redistribute the downloaded project **only** under the terms of the GPLv3 ([full text](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html)).
- No additional permissions or dual-licensing terms are granted for the combined work.
- All original copyright and license notices are preserved inside the zip.

## 2. Plugins, patches, and extensions from the MeshForge registry

Many optional components available in our registry are originally licensed under MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, ISC, or other licenses that are explicitly compatible with GPLv3.

We make every reasonable effort to ensure that only GPLv3-compatible components are offered in the registry. However, the final responsibility for verifying that every selected component is compatible with GPLv3 lies with you, the user.

Users who receive the combined project are always free to extract individual components that were originally under a GPLv3-compatible permissive license (MIT, Apache 2.0, BSD, etc.) and reuse those components under their original permissive license terms, provided they comply with those original licenses.

## 3. MeshForge website and generation tool

The MeshForge website and the software that downloads upstream code, applies customisations, combines selected plugins, and produces the final zip file are separate works that do not incorporate any GPLv3-covered code.

MeshForge.org is owned and operated by MeshEnvy NCC, a Nevada 501(c)(3) Nonprofit Corporation.
